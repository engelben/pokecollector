## ✨ Features

### 📦 Collection Management

- Short-code search like `PFL 001`
- Multi-select search results and bulk-add matching cards to the collection
- Smart scanner with Gemini-powered recognition
- Scanner retries transient Gemini capacity errors and shows clearer rate-limit / temporary-unavailable messages
- Two-step scanner matching: number ranking first, visual verification second when useful
- Scanner strips suffixes like `ex` / `GX` / `VSTAR` for broader matching
- Card modal auto-preselects a likely variant from TCGdex variant flags

### 🗂️ Sets, Binders & Wishlist
- Set overview with completion progress and per-set checklist

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Git-Romer/pokecollector.git
cd pokecollector
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
JWT_SECRET_KEY=some_long_random_string

# Optional
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES=en,de
PUBLIC_MODE=false
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Open

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| App | http://localhost:3000 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### 4. First Sync

On first launch, trigger a sync from the app to populate sets and cards from TCGdex.

### 5. Login

- In single-user mode, login is skipped and the app auto-authenticates as admin
- In multi-user mode, use the admin account created from `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is omitted, a random password may be logged during bootstrap
