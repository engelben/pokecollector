## Models

### `Card`

- Composite primary key: `{tcg_card_id}_{lang}`, for example `sv1-1_de`
- `tcg_card_id` stores the original TCGdex card id
- `set_id` stores the original TCGdex set id, not the composite set row id
- `rarity` is read-only API data
- Variant availability is represented by boolean flags:
  - `variants_normal`
  - `variants_reverse`
  - `variants_holo`
  - `variants_first_edition`

### `CollectionItem`

- Stores user-owned copies of cards
- Active fields: `card_id`, `user_id`, `quantity`, `condition`, `variant`, `purchase_price`, `lang`
- Variant values are now the physical print variants only: `Normal`, `Holo`, `Reverse Holo`, `First Edition`
- The old grading UI is gone; the database migration history still contains a legacy `grade` column, but it is not part of the current ORM model or API schema
- Unique constraint in the ORM is `card_id + variant + lang`

### `User`

- Fields include `role`, `avatar_id`, and `must_change_password`
- `must_change_password` is returned by auth responses and enforced by the frontend after login

### `Setting`

- Global key/value table
- Used for admin-only settings such as sync cadence and auth mode

### `UserSetting`

- Per-user key/value table
- Used for isolated user preferences and secrets
- Unique constraint: `user_id + key`

### Other Core Models

- `Set`
- `WishlistItem`
- `Binder` / `BinderCard`
- `ProductPurchase`
- `PriceHistory`
- `PortfolioSnapshot`
- `SyncLog`
- `ImageCache`
- `CustomCardMatch`

## Settings Scope

Current settings are split in `backend/api/settings.py`:

- `PER_USER_KEYS`
  - `language`
  - `currency`
  - `price_primary`
  - `price_display`
  - `telegram_bot_token`
  - `telegram_chat_id`
  - `telegram_enabled`
  - `price_alerts_enabled`
  - `price_alert_threshold`
  - `gemini_api_key`
  - `trainer_name`
- `ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`
  - `full_sync_interval_days`
  - `price_sync_interval_minutes`
  - `multi_user_mode`
  - `tcgdex_sync_languages`

Important behavior:

- Each user only reads and writes their own `UserSetting` rows
- Admin-only settings are stored globally in `settings`
- `tcgdex_sync_languages` is seeded from `TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES` only when the row does not exist yet; afterward the DB value is authoritative
- Admin users can receive initial fallback values from env vars for Telegram and Gemini
- `recognize.py` intentionally reads Gemini only from the current user's `UserSetting`; there is no cross-user fallback

## Sync & Backup Behavior

### Sync

- `/api/sync/` and `/api/sync/prices` enforce admin access
- Sync status returns current flags plus the last 10 sync log rows
- Full sync and price sync can be rescheduled through dedicated endpoints

### Selective Backup

`GET /api/backup/download` accepts `include` as a comma-separated query param.

Supported groups:

- `full`
- `collection`
- `users`
- `cards`
- `products`
- `system`
- `images`

Current table mapping:

- `collection`: `collection`, `wishlist`, `binders`, `binder_cards`
- `users`: `users`, `user_settings`, `settings`
- `cards`: `cards`, `sets`, `price_history`, `custom_card_matches`
- `products`: `product_purchases`, `portfolio_snapshots`
- `system`: `sync_log`
- `images`: `image_cache`

If `include=full`, image cache is excluded unless `images` is also explicitly included.

### Automatic Pre-upgrade Backup

The backend image installs PostgreSQL 18 client tools so `pg_dump` can back up the default PostgreSQL 18 service and newer external PostgreSQL 18 servers. PostgreSQL requires `pg_dump` to be at least as new as the server major version.

`backend/services/pre_upgrade_backup.py` runs before `init_db()` startup migrations.

Behavior:

- Reads the current app version from `VERSION` through `backend/main.py`.
- Reads `settings.last_successful_app_version` from the existing database.
- Skips fresh installs where the `settings` table does not exist yet.
- Creates a full SQL dump in `/app/backups` when an existing install starts on a new version.
- Uses filenames like `pre_upgrade_1.17.0_to_1.18.0_20260526_010500.sql`.
- Records `last_successful_app_version` only after startup initialization succeeds.
- Retains the newest `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP` automatic backups, default `10`, minimum `1`.
- Writes dumps to a temporary filename first, then atomically renames after a successful non-empty `pg_dump` so partial files are not treated as valid backups.

Environment controls:

- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_ENABLED`, default `true`
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_REQUIRED`, default `true`; when true, startup fails before migrations if `pg_dump` fails
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP`, default `10`, minimum `1`

## Scanner Notes

`backend/api/recognize.py` implements a two-step flow:

1. Gemini extracts card metadata from the uploaded photo
2. TCGdex candidate results are ranked by recognized card number
3. If the number is not decisive and there are enough candidates, Gemini visually compares the top candidates and picks the best match

Gemini error handling:

- Transient `502`, `503`, and `504` responses are retried with backoff
- `429` is returned as a rate-limit/capacity message
- Invalid API keys get a dedicated user-facing message
- Temporary Gemini outages are returned clearly instead of leaking as generic backend `500` errors
- Gemini requests send the API key via header instead of the request URL

Additional matching behavior:

- Name suffixes like `EX`, `GX`, `V`, `VMAX`, `VSTAR`, `TAG TEAM`, `BREAK`, and `LV.X` are stripped before search
- Search may fall back from detected card language to English
- Result payload includes recognized metadata and candidate matches

## Bulk Collection Add

`POST /api/collection/bulk-add` accepts `BulkCollectionAddRequest` with multiple `CollectionItemCreate` items and returns `BulkCollectionAddResponse`:

- `added`: new collection rows created
- `updated`: existing matching rows whose quantity was incremented
- `failed`: items that could not be added
- `errors`: per-card error details

Each item is committed independently, so one invalid or unavailable card does not roll back the rest of the batch. Existing rows are matched by card, variant, language, and current user.

## Notifications

`backend/services/telegram.py` now accepts `user_id` and reads Telegram credentials from that user's `UserSetting` rows first.

## Migrations

- Migrations are raw SQL statements in `backend/database.py`
- They are idempotent and run on startup
- Automatic pre-upgrade backups run before `init_db()` migrations on existing installs when the app version changes
- Legacy migration comments still mention older columns like `grade` or removed integrations, but the current runtime model and routers do not include eBay functionality
