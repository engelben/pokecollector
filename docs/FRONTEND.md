## Auth Flow

### `AuthContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`.

Responsibilities:

- Fetches `/api/auth/mode` on startup
- In single-user mode, attempts `/api/auth/me` without a token
- In multi-user mode, restores user from stored token if present
- Exposes:
  - `user`
  - `loading`
  - `multiUser`
  - `loginUser(token, userData)`
  - `updateCurrentUser(updates)`
  - `logout()`

Security-related behavior:

- `logout()` removes token and user from local storage
- Logout forces a full page reload to clear cached React Query data and prevent cross-user leakage
- Axios also clears auth state on `401`

### Login and Password Change

- `pages/Login.jsx` is only used when `multiUser === true`
- `App.jsx` defines an inline `ForcePasswordChangeScreen`
- If `user.must_change_password` is true, normal app routes are blocked until `/api/auth/me/force-password` succeeds

## Settings & Localization

### `SettingsContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/SettingsContext.jsx`.

Provides:

- `settings`
- `updateSettings(updates)`
- `t(path)`
- `language`
- `priceDisplay`
- `pricePrimary`
- `currency`
- `currencySymbol`
- `formatPrice(eurAmount)`

Notes:

- Translation bundles are loaded from `i18n/de.js`, `i18n/en.js`, and `i18n/zh.js`
- UI languages are now `DE`, `EN`, and `ZH`
- USD display uses Frankfurter exchange rates client-side

### `useTheme`

Defined in `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.js`.

- Stores the selected theme in `localStorage`
- Applies theme via `data-theme` on `document.documentElement`
- Available themes:
  - `default`
  - `fire`
  - `water`
  - `grass`
  - `electric`
  - `psychic`
  - `dragon`
  - `dark`
  - `fairy`

## Navigation

### Home / Portal Navigation

- `pages/HomeScreen.jsx` is the main portal view
- The app now uses a compact navigation pattern with 6 primary portal items on the home screen
- Secondary sections are organized with grouped tabs on individual pages

### `TabNav`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/TabNav.jsx`.

- Reusable horizontal tab bar
- Marks a tab active if the current pathname equals or starts with the tab path
- Used by pages such as `Dashboard`, `Collection`, `Wishlist`, `Binders`, `Analytics`, `Products`, `Leaderboard`, and `Achievements`

### `Layout` and `AppNav`

- `components/Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `components/AppNav.jsx` shows the current page title and multi-user logout control

## Key Screens

### `pages/Login.jsx`

- Multi-user login screen
- Supports quick return to the last signed-in user via `lastUser` and `lastUserAvatar` in local storage

### `pages/Leaderboard.jsx`

- Social ranking view for multi-user mode
- Uses `TabNav`

### `pages/Compare.jsx`

- Side-by-side trainer comparison
- Route parameter: `userId`

### `pages/Achievements.jsx`

- Shows achievements for current user or another user when `:userId` is present

### `pages/Settings.jsx`

- Mixes per-user preferences and admin-only controls
- Includes:
  - profile name editing
  - avatar picker
  - theme picker
  - language and currency controls
  - Telegram and Gemini keys
  - sync controls
  - auth mode toggle
  - backup and restore
  - Community sections for contributors and supporters

## Card UI

### `CardItem` / `CardModal`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/CardItem.jsx`.

Current behavior:

- `CardItem` renders the card tile
- `CardModal` displays detailed pricing, price history, metadata, and add-to-collection actions
- Rarity is displayed as read-only API metadata
- Variant selection is limited to:
  - `Normal`
  - `Holo`
  - `Reverse Holo`
  - `First Edition`
- Variant auto-preselect logic:
  - preselects the only available variant if there is exactly one
  - defaults to `Holo` when holo exists without normal or reverse
- Shows available variants from TCGdex flags

### `pages/CardSearch.jsx`

- Main search UI for locally cached TCGdex cards and matched custom cards
- Supports select mode for search results
- Can select the current page or all matching search results
- Bulk-add sends selected cards to `/api/collection/bulk-add` with default quantity `1`, condition `NM`, no variant, no purchase price, and the card language
- Bulk-add success toast reports added, updated, and failed counts

### `CardScanner`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/CardScanner.jsx`.

- Upload/camera capture flow
- Calls `/api/cards/recognize`
- Displays recognized matches, including rarity
- Shows clearer scanner errors returned by the backend for Gemini rate limits, invalid keys, and temporary capacity outages
- Lets the user add a matched card to the collection
- Supports language selection in the add modal: `de`, `en`, `zh`

## API Layer

`frontend/src/api/client.js` is the central Axios client.

Notable frontend API bindings include:

- auth mode and force-password endpoints
- GitHub community endpoints
- social endpoints for leaderboard / compare / achievements
- selective backup download via `downloadBackup(include)`

## Removed / No Longer Documented

- No eBay integration in the current frontend
- No grading UI in the current frontend
